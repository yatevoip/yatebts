What is Network in a Box Web GUI
--------------------------------

A Graphical Web Interface used to create configurations files for YateBTS.

It has tree parts:

1. Subscribers contains: List Subscribers, Online Subscribers, Rejected IMSIs
List Subscribers - each IMSI can be inserted individually or
                   insert a regular expression to be used to match the subscribers IMSIs.

Online Subscribers - lists all the subscribers online.

Rejected IMSIs - lists all the rejected subscribers.

2. BTS Configuration - has all the sections from ybts.conf file that can be configured.
 
3. Outgoing - configure outbound connection On IAX or SIP protocol with their specific parameters.

Requirements
------------

PHP, Apache, YateBTS are required to run the software.

Setup
-----

Assuming you installed YateBTS, this sources are located in /usr/local/share/yate/nib_web

 cd /var/www/html   (or cd /var/www on debian based OS)
 ln -s /usr/local/share/yate/nib_web yatebts_nib


Configuration
-------------

The interface needs write right to yate's configuration directory.

The command that has to be runned as root (if the default settings are set) is:
chmod -R a+rw /usr/local/etc/yatebts_nib/ 

Failing to configure the right permissions will make the interface display some errors
the first time when it's used.

For listing online or rejected IMSIs, a socket connection is used to communicate with YATE.
The default IP set in parameter $yate_ip and the default PORT(5038) are used.
If YATE is not running or if it uses other types of connections (SSL, TLS), the interface will not work.
