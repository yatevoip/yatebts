What is Network in a Box Web GUI
--------------------------------

A Graphical Web Interface used to create configurations files for YateBTS.

It has tree parts:

1. Subscribers contains: List Subscribers, Online Subscribers, Rejected IMSIs
List Subscribers - each IMSI can be inserted individually or
                   insert a regular expression to be used to match the subscribers IMSIs.

Online Subscribers - lists all the subscribers online.

Rejected IMSIs - lists all the rejected subscribers.

2. BTS Configuration - has all the sections from ybts.conf file that can be configured.
 
3. Outgoing - configure outbound connection On IAX or SIP protocol with their specific parameters.

Requirements
------------

PHP is required to run the software.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration files used by the interface are: default.php and config.php.

default.php is a configuration file in which the default parameters are set. 
Please don't change the default configuration, use file config.php if you need to change 
parameters values.

Before using the interface, the permissions for the directories that are 
set in the $yate_conf_dir variable MUST be set.

The command that has to be runned as root (if the default settings are set) is:
chmod -R a+rw /usr/local/etc/yatebts_nib/ 

Failing to configure the right permissions will make the interface display some errors
the first time when it's used.

For listing online or rejected IMSIs, a socket connection is used to communicate with YATE.
The default IP set in parameter $yate_ip and the default PORT(5038) are used.
If YATE is not running or if it uses other types of connections (SSL, TLS), the interface will not work.
