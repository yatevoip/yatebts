What is YateBTS
---------------

YateBTS is an open source GSM Base Station software.

You can use this software to create a 2G GSM network, either standalone or connected to
the public telephony network.

The use of a non-DSP aproach for GSM protocol together with a SIP implementation
that supports an IMS core and SS7 core network makes it a disruptive technology.


Please see the INSTALL file for information of how to download, build and install YateBTS.


Configuration
-------------

YateBTS is a module for the Yate telephony engine.

You will need to configure Yate to load it and also YateBTS itself.


YateBTS
-------

The module is configured by the ybts.conf file. Depending on the install method you may
have just an ybts.conf.sample which you will need to copy as ybts.conf

As a minimum you will need to configure the radio band and frequency (ARFCN) on which
YateBTS will operate. Please read the minimal instructions at top of ybts.conf.sample

Depending on the transceiver you will need to edit the path setting in ybts.conf:

    [transceiver]
    Path=./transceiver

replace ./transceiver with ./transceiver-rad1 or ./transceiver-uhd or ./transceiver-usrp1

Alternatively you may create a symbolic link to the desired transceiver:

    cd /usr/lib64/yate/bts    (or wherever it is installed)
    ln -s transceiver-rad1 transceiver


Yate
----

Yate will need to know to load the ybts.yate module. For this add a line in the yate.conf
file in section [general]. You will need to create the section if doesn't exist already.

    [general]
    extrapath=bts

This will tell Yate to load modules from the extra modules directory bts.
