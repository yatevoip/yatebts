Welcome to the MBTS section of Yate-BTS, a derivation of OpenBTS.
(Note: OpenBTS is a trademark of Range Networks, Inc., not affiliated with
the developers or supporters of MBTS.)


For additional information and support, refer to http://yatebts.com.


These are the directories:

CommonLib	Common-use libraries, mostly C++ wrappers for basic facilities.
Control		Control-layer functions for the protocols of GSM 04.08 and SIP.
GSM		The GSM stack.
RRLP		Radio Resource Location Protocol
TRXManager	The interface between the GSM stack and the radio.
Transceiver	The software transceiver and specific installation tests.
apps		OpenBTS application binaries.



By default, OpenBTS assumes the following UDP port assignments:

5060 -- Yate SIP interface
XXXX -- Yate-BTS/MBTS socket interface
5700-range -- OpenBTS-transceiver interface

These can be controlled in the CONFIG table in /etc/OpenBTS.db.

Standrd paths:
/OpenBTS -- Binary installation and authorization keys.
/etc/OpenBTS -- Configuration databases.
/var/run/OpenBTS -- Real-time reporting databases.

The script apps/setUpFiles.sh will create these directories and install the
correct files in them.
