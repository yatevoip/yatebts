The following tools are required:
- A subversion (svn) client; As root go to /usr/src or whereever you'd like to store source code
- GnuMake: GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files
- Autoconf: Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
- GCC: GNU Compiler Collection
- libusb-1.0-0-dev: (2:0.1.12-23.3 and others) Library for programming USB applications without the knowledge of Linux kernel internals

Both YateBTS and Yate can be built from a source tarball. In this case subversion and autoconf are not needed.


Yate instalation
----------------

Below is a short install guide for Yate. For more detailed information please check http://docs.yate.ro/wiki/Compiling_and_installing_Yate_from_SVN

The prerequisites of installing Yate are the same as above. You need at least Yate version 5.1.0

To install Yate:

Download Yate sources from the SVN
Once you have the svn client installed, getting the sources is simple: you just type the following command in your terminal:
    cd /usr/src/
    svn checkout http://voip.null.ro/svn/yate/trunk yate

Install Yate from SVN

Go to directory where Yate was downloded and run autogen.sh. This will generate the configure script that checks dependencies.
Then run make install-noapi that will compile and install Yate.
Instead of make install-noapi you can use make install but make sure to install doxygen or kdoc package.
    cd yate/
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make install-noapi

If you get any errors when running ./configure you'll probably have to install additional packages.

If you try to run yate and get:

yate: error while loading shared libraries: libyate.so.5.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Then run:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

For additional information about Yate installation and configuration, please see Yate documentation Wiki:
http://docs.yate.ro/wiki/Beginners_in_Yate


Install YateBTS
---------------

Download YateBTS

You can download the sources in any directory. I choose /usr/src
    cd /usr/src
    svn checkout http://voip.null.ro/svn/yatebts/trunk yatebts

Check dependencies
Run autogen.sh to generate configure script that will check dependencies.
    cd yatebts/
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure

If you encounter the following error then you need to install libusb1-dev or libusb1-devel and then run ./configure again.
    checking for libusb-1.0/libusb.h... no
    configure: error: This header file is required.

Install YateBTS

To compile and install YateBTS run:
    make install

After this, the YateBTS modules/scripts/configurations will be moved in the appropriate directories where other Yate modules/scripts/configurations are located.
